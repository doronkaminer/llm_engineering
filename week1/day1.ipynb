Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you do this with me, either at the same time, or (perhaps better) right afterwards. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

    "You may notice that if you try `display_summary(\"https://openai.com\")` - it doesn't work! That's because OpenAI has a fancy website that uses Javascript. There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
